# 🚀 Stack & Queue Based Algorithms  

Welcome to the **Stack and Queue Algorithms** repository! 🎯  
This repo contains efficient implementations of classical and modern problems solved using **Monotonic Stack, Monotonic Queue, Expression Evaluation, and Stock Span Algorithms** in both **Java** and **Python**.  

Stacks and Queues are fundamental data structures used in a wide variety of problems such as **Next Greater Element, Sliding Window, Expression Parsing, and Stock Price Analysis**. This repo is your **one-stop resource** to learn, implement, and master these concepts.

## 📘 Algorithms Covered  

### 🔹 1. Monotonic Stack  
- Maintains elements in **increasing or decreasing order**.  
- Used in problems like:  
  - Next Greater Element  
  - Histogram Largest Rectangle  
  - Rainwater Trapping  

### 🔹 2. Monotonic Queue  
- Queue with ordered elements for **efficient max/min retrieval**.  
- Commonly used in:  
  - Sliding Window Maximum  
  - Dynamic Programming optimizations  

### 🔹 3. Expression Evaluation  
- Evaluates infix mathematical expressions with operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.  
- Uses **two stacks**:  
  - One for numbers  
  - One for operators  

### 🔹 4. Stock Span Problem  
- Classic **stack problem**.  
- For each day’s stock price, find the number of consecutive days before it with a lower or equal price.

## ⚡ Tech Stack  

- **Java** (for strongly-typed, OOP-style solutions)  
- **Python** (for concise, readable implementations)
